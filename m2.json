  "Someone ": "Ok but not good for protections purpose and about yellowish so it is being only one week i am using this cover so it is not turned yellow till now",
  "Ricky Parmar": "I was kind of confused between 1.5K Spigen cover vs Rs 250 Amozo cover and happen to take a chance on Amozo brand. To be honest I did not expect this product to be this good and I absolutely recommend anyone to go with this cover. I cannot differentiate between Spigen cover and Amozo cover even in terms of touch, feel and quality. It does protect your phone and is very similar to Spigen cover that I am using on my Samsung S9. This transparent cover might last for 6 months given this product yellow stain occurrence and it should be OK at this price point.",
